# Overview

This is a To Do List program in Erlang. This is my first time working with Erlang, so I was hoping to gain more knowledge of how to use a functional programming language. 

In this program, I created an add task function that will ask the user for a description of their task and as a default mark it as incomplete. Then the user will have the option to mark tasks as complete. I used recursion to loop through this program, until the user is content with their tasks of the day. 

My main purpose in writing this program was to learn more about functional languages and to practice using Erlang. I also wanted to know how lists, records, and recursion work in Erlang.
